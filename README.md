🔑 How to Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

Log in to GitHub
Go to https://github.com
 and make sure you’re signed in with the account you’ll use for the repo.

Open Developer Settings

Click your profile picture (top right).

Go to Settings.

Scroll down → Developer settings.

Go to Personal Access Tokens

In the left menu, click Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic).

Click Generate new token → Generate new token (classic).

Set the Token Scopes

Give it a name (e.g., Repo Access).

Select an expiration (e.g., 90 days).

Under scopes, check ✅ repo (this gives full access to private repos you’re a collaborator on).

Generate and Copy the Token

Click Generate token.

Copy the token shown (you won’t see it again later).

💻 How to Use the Token When Cloning

In your terminal, run:

git clone https://github.com/OWNER-NAME/REPO-NAME.git


Git will ask for:

Username → enter your GitHub username.

Password → paste the token you just generated (not your real password).

⚠️ Notes

Keep your PAT safe — don’t share it.

If you already tried cloning before, Git might have cached wrong credentials. Run:

git credential-cache exit



🚀 Git Workflow Guide for manfess-web
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

First time only – download the project to your computer:
# ssh -T git@github.com

# git clone git@github.com:vildashnetwork/WICIKI-MEDIA-WEB.git
# cd manfess-web

2️⃣ Check the Status of Your Repo

See what has changed:

# git status

3️⃣ Pull Latest Changes (ALWAYS do this before starting work)
# git pull origin main

4️⃣ Create a New Branch (recommended)

Keep your work separate from main:

# git checkout -b feature-branch-name

5️⃣ Stage Changes

Add modified files to be committed:

# git add .


or add specific files:

# git add filename.js

6️⃣ Commit Changes

Save your staged changes locally with a message:

# git commit -m "Describe what you changed"

7️⃣ Push Changes to GitHub

If working on a branch:

# git push origin feature-branch-name


If pushing directly to main (⚠️ not recommended unless urgent):

# git push origin main

8️⃣ Switch Branches
# git checkout main

9️⃣ Merge Branch into Main

When your branch is done and reviewed:

# git checkout main
# git pull origin main
# git merge feature-branch-name
# git push origin main

🔁 Other Useful Commands

View branches:

git branch


Delete a branch (after merging):

# git branch -d feature-branch-name


See commit history:

# git log --oneline


✅ Workflow Recommendation

Always git pull origin main before starting work.

Use feature branches for new work.

Commit often with meaningful messages.

Push your branch and make a Pull Request on GitHub for review.
